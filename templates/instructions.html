  ## **+ Shoes and Boots**

* 2) Remove insoles, if applicable.
* 3) Apply 5-10 sprays of product to the inside of each shoe. Make sure the entire inside of the shoe is wet.
* 4) Apply 1-2 sprays of to each side of insoles, if applicable.

* 6) Allow shoes to dry completely before wearing.

For natural fibers and blends including cotton, wool, rayon, linnen, bamboo, etc., one application of Trekfresh will usually prevent odors for the life of the garment. For synthetic fabrics, Trekfresh has more difficulty binding to the fibers, but will last up to 10 washes.**
